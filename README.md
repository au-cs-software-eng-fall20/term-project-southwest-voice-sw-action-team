## Next Steps for new Developers 

Welcome! To South West Action Dev Team! For this site we used a Jekyll static site using the theme 'minima' similar to theme used for 
our class last semester. If you plan on adding information or just checking out the site please follow these steps 

1) Clone this repo
2) [Download Jekyll on terminal or your Bash](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
    If errors occur uses these Documenations.  [Link] (https://askubuntu.com/questions/406643/warning-you-dont-have-a-directory-in-your-path-gem-executables-will-not-run)
    PLEASE NOT THIS FOR macOS
    if you run this command `PATH="`ruby -e 'puts Gem.user_dir'`/bin:$PATH"` then now run this command on terminal `gem install --user-install bundler jekyll`
3) Check if you have it on your terminal by running  `jekyll` 
4) To run the webite on your local computer run   `jekyll s` this run the site on your local server
5) to edit any thing on the site got to the .md files and mess around with the site! Enjoy
