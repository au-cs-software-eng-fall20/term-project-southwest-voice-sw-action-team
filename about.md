## Mission
The SW Capitol Digital Heritage Museum in an online curation of the rich, diverse history and culture of the Southwest-Captiol neighborhood in Washington, DC.
The mission of the SW Capitol Digital Heritage Museum is to provide an online repository of images that enable the community to showcase their unique racial and economic diversity, talent, and culture. Our hope is that students and educators across various disciplines can understand intersectionality of policies and regulations on community change and health. This effort is intended to restore the lost history of the nation's capitol oldest neighborhood.

## AU Collaboration
This site was developed in collaboration with Chris Williams at SW Action and Dozie Anazia, Rocio Bereilh, Julia Murray and Gianna Williams from American University.
